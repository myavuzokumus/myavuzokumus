# Hi, it's me, Yavuz! 👋
### Software Engineer specializing in AI & Cloud-Native Systems

> I'm an engineer driven by a simple belief: for every complex problem, there is an elegant, high-performance solution waiting to be built. My journey, inspired by the boundless worlds of gaming, has evolved into a passion for architecting intelligent, robust, and beautiful systems—from the bare metal to the user's fingertips.

My professional focus is concentrated on two core pillars where I aim to deliver maximum impact:

*   **🧠 AI & Machine Learning:** Architecting and deploying production-grade intelligent systems. My expertise spans from computer vision pipelines with `Python` and `Langchain` to exploring next-generation AI performance with `Mojo 🔥`.
*   **☁️ Cloud-Native & High-Performance Systems:** Forging rock-solid, lightning-fast services with `Rust` and deploying them on scalable cloud infrastructure using technologies like `AWS`, `Cloudflare` and `Docker`.

Beyond my core focus, I leverage my experience in frontend and game development as a creative outlet and to build full-stack personal projects:

*   **📱 Frontend & Mobile:** Using `Flutter` to create intuitive user interfaces for my backend services.
*   **🎮 Game Development:** Exploring creativity and interactive design with the `Godot Engine`.

### 🔭 What I'm Focused On Now

My primary goal is to deepen my expertise in AI and Cloud technologies:
*   **Mastering `Rust`:** Building a deep understanding of systems programming for high-performance cloud services.
*   **Production-Ready AI:** Architecting scalable, end-to-end MLOps pipelines with `Python` and `FastAPI`.

As a passion, I continue to:
*   **Build `SCSmash!`:** My personal game project using the `Godot Engine`.
*   **Explore `Swift`:** Strategically learning Swift to understand native platform capabilities.
